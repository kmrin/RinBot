# Privacy Policy

## Usage of Data

The bot may use stored data, as defined below, for different features including but not limited to:
Welcoming joining users (when enabled) and command handling.
No usage of data outside the aformentioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.

## Stored Information

The bot may store the following information automatically when being invited to a new Discord Server:

- `guild_id` with the Server's ID as a value.
- `user_id` with the Server's users IDs as values.

No other information outside of the above mentioned will be stored.

## Updating Data

The data may be updated when using specific features of the bot.
Such updates of data often requires the input of a user, including data that can be seen as identifiable and sensitive, such as text messages. This data is only kept in the database and only used for its intended purpose.

## Temporarely stored Information

The bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time to reduce requests to its database.
After a specified time period the cached data will be discarded and only re-aquired when needed.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

## Removal of Data

### Automatic removal

Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server.
This can be achieved by using the moderation features provided by Discord.
Re-adding the bot back to the server will store data again, as described in the Stored Information section of this policy.

### Manual removal

Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at `km.rin@proton.me`.
For security reasons we will ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
